            <p>I discovered my love for storytelling at a young age. However, it wasn't until middle school until I discovered the medium that
                would enrapture me for the rest of my life. As with anything, my first videos weren't great, and going through a school system that heavily
                emphasized STEM and did not offer many resources for the arts didn't help either. I am almost entirely self-taught and I honed my skills through
                making projects for school or other clubs. From music videos to short films, I've done it all.

            <p>
                When I'm not telling stories, you can typically find me at the climbing gym with my friends.
                I also enjoy keeping aquariums and cooking!
